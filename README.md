# NeuroFlex
App created using the React Native JS Framework and Expo CLI with FirebaseDB as the backend. 

Over 14 million people globally are affected with neuromuscular disease. A typical on-site Electromyography (EMG) costs $289 to $496 and patients report anywhere from mild discomfort to severe pain during a test. Additionally, 48% of people have to wait over a year for diagnoses due to limited accessibility to tests. Our team (Avni, Avnith, Jason, Kalib, Sophia) developed NueroFlex, a cost-effective, wireless, and user-friendly surface EMG that revolutionizes at-home neuromuscular monitoring. Our product connects to the app via the Bluetooth Low Energy Protocol (BLE). NeuroFlex was selected as one of five Innovation Summit Finalists for the 2024 Conrad Challenge in the Health & Nutrition category. Over 4,000 students from 50 different countries participate in the Conrad Challenge annually. A full list of 2024 Innovation Summit Finalists can be found at [conradchallenge.org/2024-innovation-summit-finalists](https://www.conradchallenge.org/2024-innovation-summit-finalists).
